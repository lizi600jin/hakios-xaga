/*
 * The touch screen of the Redmi Note 11T Pro (xaga): a Novatek NT36672E on the MT6895's SPI2, as a
 * source of touches for /dev/hakios-touch (sys/hakios.input.h). Only with boot-arg touchscreen=3:
 * every pin and address below belongs to this phone.
 *
 * Why the pins are driven by hand and not through the SPI controller: the controller's register
 * layout for this SoC is the same as the MT6768's (Linux drivers/spi/spi-mt65xx.c covers both), but
 * the *pin function number* that turns GPIO109..112 into SPI2_A_MI/MO/CLK/CSB is in a pinctrl table
 * this tree does not have -- xaga-mt6895-touch.dtsi names it (PINMUX_GPIO110__FUNC_SPI2_A_CSB) and
 * the number it stands for is generated into a header the vendor does not publish. The four pins
 * driven as plain GPIO need no such number, and at the speed a touch report needs (66 bytes at
 * 100 kHz, under a millisecond) the difference does not show. The loader's own mtkspi.h makes the
 * same trade for the MT6768's firmware download.
 *
 * The chip runs its firmware out of its own flash and comes up reporting after a power-on, which
 * is why this driver sends it nothing: Android's driver only downloads firmware when the version
 * on the chip is older than the one in /vendor/firmware. A reset would put it back into its ROM
 * bootloader, which answers but cannot report touches, so nothing here resets it.
 *
 * What is read: address 0 is the report, 65 bytes, the last a checksum. Every finger after the
 * first byte is six of them:
 *
 *   [0]   the finger's number in the top five bits, in bits 0..2 what it is doing
 *         (1 landed, 2 moved, 0 or 3 lifted)
 *   [1]   x, the top eight bits
 *   [2]   y, the top eight bits
 *   [3]   x's low four bits in the top half, y's in the bottom
 *   [4]   the pressure
 *   [5]   the pressure's high byte, for the first two fingers only
 *
 * Register and protocol references: the driver the phone ships, in the Redmi Note 11T Pro's kernel
 * tree under drivers/input/touchscreen/NT36672C/ (nt36xxx.c: CTP_SPI_READ, nvt_set_page,
 * nvt_ts_point_data_checksum, nvt_ts_work_func).

 * line after it POINT_DATA_LEN becomes 108 instead of 65. In the ten-times mode each finger is
 * still six bytes, but x and y are sixteen bits wide and the pressure array moves to byte 98.
 * This phone's panel is ten-times: Android registers ABS_MT_POSITION_X with a maximum of 10799,
 * which is 1080 * 10 - 1, and the device tree asks for super-resolution-factor = <10>.
 *
 * Reading 65 bytes out of a 108-byte report is what made the vertical axis look unsolvable: the
 * upper bits of y were never on the wire as far as this driver was concerned, so no amount of
 * fitting could find them. Four corners pressed on the real panel and compared against Android
 * left a least-squares slope of -9.15 that no flip or scale could explain.

 * The read length and the decoding are separate questions and are answered separately here.
 *
 * The length is not in doubt: the vendor driver that is actually compiled on this phone
 * (drivers/input/touchscreen/NVT36672C, selected by Makefile:122 through
 * CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NVT36672C_HOSTDL_SPI) sets NVT_SUPER_RESOLUTION_10S to 10 at nt36xxx.h:110,
 * and the line under it makes POINT_DATA_LEN 108. So it asks the chip for 109 bytes on every
 * interrupt, on every panel, whatever mode the coordinates then turn out to be in. This driver
 * has been asking for sixty-six and reading the first sixty-five.
 *
 * Those extra bytes turned out to hold nothing this driver needs: bytes 65..107 were byte for
 * byte identical across forty reports. What settled the decode was the image, not the length.
 * With fw02 -- the file the device downloads on its own, which nvt_match_fw picks from the
 * lockdown bytes -- the ten-times branch is the right one: five presses gave x 112, 969, 101,
 * 999, 574 and y 2346, 2347, 110, 156, 1367 for physical (91,2363) (1003,2383) (91,157)
 * (997,116) (573,1290), all within a fingertip. With novatek_ts_fw.bin the same branch gave

 *
 * The measurements agree. This chip answers its trim id (0e 00 00 72 66 03) because that lives in
 * ROM and is readable with the MCU in its bootloader; the event buffer at 0x22D00 returns bytes
 * that are stable within a run and different across runs, which is SRAM nobody is maintaining; the
 * handshake byte at 0x22D51 answers neither 0xA0 nor 0x00; and the reset-state byte at 0x22D60
 * stays 0x3A through an eng reset, a 0x55 and fifty polls -- 0x3A is below RESET_STATE_INIT 0xA0,
 * so the firmware never started. Sending an image is the only thing left that the vendor does and
 * this driver did not.
 *
 * The addresses are NT36675_memory_map's, chosen the same way EVENT_BUF_ADDR was: through the trim
 * id. hw_crc is 2 for that map (NT36675_hw_info, nt36xxx_mem_map.h:222-225), which is why the
 * LENGTH register gets four bytes rather than three.
